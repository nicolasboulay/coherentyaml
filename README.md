# coherentyaml

The goal of coherentYaml is to create scheme for yaml. Instead of
using a description of what is expected, the schema looks like an
example with some logical operator.

A minium set of keyword have been created :
- "Coherent" (a kind of logicial and)
- "OR"
- "Not"

The "Not" is not fonctionnel.

./coherentyaml fichier1.yml fichier2.yml

The 2 structures are compared. 

"Type" are defined by neutral Ã©lement (1, -1, 1.0, ""). Each key
in object must be coherent and are not mandatory. 

Each structure is coherent to it-self. Coherence is symetrical.

The tool compile with go build
into cmd/coherentyaml.
